### Who
This is Mohammad Nasirifar. I am a computer science student and I work as a backend developer.

### What
I really like [xkcd](http://xkcd.com), [9gag](http://9gag.com), programming, math and hiking. 
Talking about less generic stuff, I like micro-services, machine learning, and theory of computation.
I don't like facebook.com and I spend some time browsing [github](https://github.com/trending) as a daily basis.

### Why
The main reason that I write this blog is that I don't like to forget about the things I learn, and I have found out that typing (as opposed to actually writing stuff down) would save me some time, and blog posts (as opposed to papers) are more accessible to me (and anyone else).

### Where
I live in Tehran, Iran.

### When
This is probably the most uselss thing that I have ever typed but it's 14:46.
