Hey there! This is EX-PEEK: EXploring programming/math topics, linux utilities etc., each in (about) a weEK.

I guess for the first few weeks I'd be fighting with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)+[Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole)+[github pages](https://pages.github.com) so I guess that's gonna cost me a litle time early on and throw me off the schedule a little bit. Also I am waiting for my domain name purchase to be accepted to stay clear of the possible nightmare of switching from colonelmo.github.io to expeek.ir.

Stay tuned!
