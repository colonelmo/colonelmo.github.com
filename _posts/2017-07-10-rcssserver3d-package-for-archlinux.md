title: `rcssserver3d` package for archlinux
---

-----

I have decided to create an aur package for `rcssserver3d` to make life easier
for me and anyone else doing 3d soccer simulation on archlinux.

I'm basically following [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Creating_a_new_package)
for creating a new aur package. The steps are relatively simple should you
decide creating a package out of some useful tool/library/etc to make it easier
to use, install, (notice the oxford comma anyone) and maintain.
